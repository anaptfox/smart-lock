# smart-lock This is my smart lock app. In order to login you have to first register. After you register your credentials you will be 
able to login and use the smart lock app. The smart lock app uses two buttons, unlock and lock, to comunicate with a nodeMCU 
microcontroller connected to a motor and a device That I created to unlock and lock a door.
